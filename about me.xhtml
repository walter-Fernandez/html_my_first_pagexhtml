       <p> Hello, my names is Walter Fernandez
          I was student in Bronx Community College,
           I have been  working in projects and learning more about programing.
          I want to work in a place where I can improve my knowledge in programing and
          can use that knowledge to help the community.
           You can find one of my projects (my calculator program) using tkinter on my <a href="https://github.com/walter-Fernandez/tkinter">github </a>account
          I like to use tkinter because I can use my code in a graphic,
           that is why I am going to upload more projects using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a> and <a href= "http://cs.roanoke.edu/Fall2013/CPSC120A/pygame-1.9.1-docs-html/index.html">Pygame.</a></p>

       <p>I am interested in developing websites and apps because it is something that I use everyday
    However, I also interested in new opportunity to learn new things.</p>
